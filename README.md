# simple-python-bibliometrics

Goals:
The goal of this public repository is to provide a software package for bibliometricians across the world to collect their data, process it, and store it easily. The package has two focuses only:
1. The code must be as easy to use as possible
2. The code must handle all data prepations steps from downloading to visualization-ready data.

This also means the code does not do any visualization or website services.
