# simple-python-bibliometrics

Goals:
The goal of this public repository is to provide a software package for bibliometricians across the world to collect their data, process it, and store it easily. The package has two focuses only:
1. The code must be as easy to use as possible
2. The code must handle all data prepations steps from downloading to visualization-ready data.

This also means the code does not do any visualization or website services.


License and attribution:
This repository falls under the MIT license.

Contributions:
If you want to make a contribution you are very welcome, and for a good process I only need you to meet the following conditions:
1. The contributor asserts that they are the original author of the code they are submitting.
2. The contributor grants the project the right to use and distribute the code they are submitting.
3. The contributor has the right to grant the previous two points.
4. Any code submitted by a contributor is not guaranteed to be accepted or used.
This is to make sure the project for example does not accidentally publish stolen code.

PS: The project is only partially ready for production.
